## Careguide For Houseplants
A visulization on house plant maintenance
### Project Objective
The objective of this project is just to provide an easily navigable and way to easily identify visualization for house plants. The visualization will focus largely on basic information on housplant care such as being a quick reference on how much watering a particular houseplant requires or the amount of sunlight a specific houseplant may need. This visulization can then double as a quick reference guide for all plant lovers and maintaining their plants or serve as a simple visualization displaying what houseplant may be more suited towards your lifestyle.

### Potential Data Sources
1. USDA [PLANTS Database](https://plants.usda.gov/java/).
