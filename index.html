  <h1>CMPS 165 Final Project Proposal</h1>
  <h2> US Plant Care Guide</h2>
  <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>We wish to create a visualization for various types of plants that are commercially avliable in the USA.
    We will focus on basic care such as amount of water needed and amounts of sunlight required. 
    Our goal is for this guide to serve as a quick and easily navigable reference for plant maintence.
    In doing so, the visualization can also serve as a simple buyer's guide, by showing various plants and 
    their needs to jugde agaisnt your own lifestyle choices. We also plan to include more variables to examine such as 
    tempurature tolerance, drought resistance, plant types, and ph levels of soil.

      <li><a href="https://www.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a></li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Potential Data Sets</h3>
  <p>There exists a number of encyclopedia's on the subject and so, they may serve as useful sources to supplement any missing information from databases or to simplify certain aspects of the data if needed.
  Such communities can also help us narrow down choices in plants to include in the visualization.</p>
